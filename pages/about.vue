            <h3>Artist Biography</h3>
            <p>
            Pao Hung is an artist from Taiwan. She has traveled internationally and exhibited her artwork in many countries. For more than a decade, she has been living in the Napa Valley, California, and produced many artwork. Originally, she was born in the south of Formosa and grew up in the aural area of the village. The inspiration of mother nature in childhood still motivates her to create artwork today.

            It’s a passion. She started making sculptures and paintings many years ago and learned from her own experiments. Her artwork always reflects the feelings she received from the environments. Her paintings are influenced by impressionism, such work expresses her sincerity and respect to the truthful emotions from life experience. Somehow, the philosophy in behind of her sculptures fits with the post-modernism settings, where she presents a decadent image of what humanities have left in the new world. Interestingly, some of her recent paintings are humorous, entertaining the characteristics of human nature.

            The messages in her artwork tell us to look at things differently. She believes that looking at the world through a unique lens is how art can bring meanings to life.
